Operators
==========================

| **Assignment** operators are used to assign values to variables.
| The **compound assignment** operators consist of two operators as a shorthand.
| **Comparison** operators are used to compare two values.
| **Booleans** represent one of two values: True or False.
| **Logical** operators are used to combine conditional statements.
| **Membership** operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object.
| **Identity** operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location.

| The **None** keyword is used to define a null value, or no value at all. None is not the same as 0, False, or an empty string. None is a data type of its own and only None can be None.
